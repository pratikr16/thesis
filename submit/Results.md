### Data filtering

Flock count data from 16 breeding years and subsequent winters yielded a mean 420 flock counts per year (range: 67 (2001) - 672 (2005)). Except one record in August 2016, spring (Aprils, n = 24) and early autumn (Septembers, n = 76) had the fewest records, with most observations from winter (October - January, 81%, n = 5,785). Observations declined over February (11%) and March (6.8%). The mean flock size was 712 (range: 2 - 20,000), with a mean proportion of first-winter birds of 0.18 (range: 0 - 0.87). Flocks in which families were counted held on average 540 birds (range: 3 - 11,000), with an average of 27 families (range: 1 - 333) accompanied by a mean of 1.78 juveniles (range: 1 - 10). On average, marked geese were observed 626 times overall (range: 62 - 1143) were observed each year, accompanied by 0.59 juveniles (range: 0 - 11) (see Appendix 1, Figs. A1, A2).
Families on Kolguyev Island in 2016 had a mean of 2.26 juveniles (range: 0 - 6).

Families fitted with GPS transmitters travelled on average 11 km each day (range: 0 - 306). At the daily scale, families travelled a distance > 1km a mean of twice per day (range: 0 - 10), and on average 98 times (range: 63 - 367) over the tracking period.
In 2016 families, take-offs occurred on average 5 times (range: 1 - 15) a day, and 470 times (range: 328 - 659) over the tracking period. 21 family splits occurred in the 13 families tracked and were not restricted to juveniles.
Flock flight intensity reached the 90th percentile for autumns between September 26 and October 30, and  was at the 90th percentile for the last time between March 03 and April 01. Representing the arrival and departure of geese, respectively, this resulted in a mean goose winter of 165 days.
Lemming abundance from the breeding grounds transformed into a predation index ranged between 1.17 and 1.9, with very low variance between years (σ^2^ = 0.048).

### Juveniles and wintering site choice

We found no influence of the number of juveniles in a family on how far from the breeding grounds a family wintered in the first sixty days after arrival (dataset *B*: successful families in flocks, and *C*: families of marked geese, model *1*, χ^2^ B = 1.135, p B = 0.286, χ^2^ C = 2.007, p C = 0.157, see Fig. 2). Later in the winter, larger families from dataset *B* (successful families in flocks) wintered farther west (χ^2^ = 4.194, p = 0.041), while dataset *C* (families of marked geese) did not reveal any influence of juvenile number on wintering site (χ^2^ = 0.27, p = 0.6033).

### Family size in winter

The number of juveniles in a family (dataset *B*: successful families in flocks, model *2.a*) decreased through the winter (χ^2^ = 74.166, p < 0.001, see Fig. 3), but was insensitive to flock size (χ^2^ = 0.270, p = 0.6033) and summer predation (χ^2^ = 0.337, p = 0.562, see Fig. A3).
Family sizes of marked geese (dataset *C*: families of marked geese, model *2.a* adapted) decreased over time (χ^2^ = 19.936, p = < 0.001, see Fig. 3), but showed an increase with the level of summer predation (χ^2^ = 12.935, p < 0.001, see Fig. A3).
We tested whether the exclusion of unsuccessful pairs from family counts in flocks biased the data by similarly excluding such records from observations of marked geese. We confirmed this bias in sampling method by failing to find any effect of summer predation after excluding unsuccessful pairs from data *C* (χ^2^ = 0.1321, p = 0.716, see Fig. A3).
The number of successful families in flocks increased with flock size (χ^2^ = 7162, p < 0.001), and the number of days since goose arrival in autumn (χ^2^ = 171.3, p < 0.001, see Fig. 4), but was unaffected by summer predation (χ^2^ = 0, p = 0.98). Further, there were more successful families in flocks farther from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 12.73, p = 0.0004, see Fig. 5).

### Family size and autumn migration

Families of geese observed approximately one month pre-migration on Kolguyev Island (dataset *D*) had significantly more juveniles than successful families (dataset *B*) in flocks (GLM, z = -4.285, p < 0.001) and families of marked geese (dataset *C*) (GLM, z = -14.511, p < 0.001) recorded in the first two months following the population's arrival on the wintering grounds.

### Flock size in winter

Flocks were significantly smaller farther from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 66599, p = < 0.001, see Fig. A5), and grew slightly over the winter (χ^2^ = 4975, p < 0.001).
Within flocks, juvenile proportions increased through the winter (χ^2^ = 19.43, p = 0.001, see Fig. A4), and decreased with increasing flock size (χ^2^ = 5.921, p = 0.015, see Fig. A6), but did not show any effect of distance from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 1.015, p = 0.314), or of summer predation (χ^2^ = 0.021, p = 0.883).

### Probability of family splits

The daily probability of families separating (see Fig. 6) was significantly lower later in the winter (χ^2^ = 8.314, p = 0.004), and lower in larger families (χ^2^ = 11.41, p < 0.001). There was no effect of the daily number of flights (χ^2^ = 0.018, p = 0.893), nor the daily distance moved (χ^2^ = 2.99, p = 0.083). Split probability was higher in families that made cumulatively more flights over the period leading up to the split (χ^2^ = 143.23, p < 0.001), but decreased in families that moved a shorter cumulative distance over the days leading up to splits (χ^2^ = 182.63, p < 0.001). At the half-hour scale, split probability increased with time since the previous take-off (χ^2^ = 6.07, p = 0.014), but was not related to the distance travelled in the previous half hour (χ^2^ = 0.389, p = 0.533).
