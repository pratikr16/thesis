Summaries

\citet{johnson1988weak} find that cackling Canada geese form family
groups at their breeding grounds, but that the pressure of constant
foraging and the advantages of foraging in large flocks offset the
benefits of maintaining these family units while at wintering grounds.
Social organisation in small grazing geese might be determined by
immediate food availability.

\citet{BirdStudy1380} found significant morphological differences
between the proposed subspecies of Anser albifrons. The largest geese
were from around the Bering Strait, and body size, while not correlated
with breeding latitude, was positively correlated with temperature
at the breeding grounds, breeding habitat, and migration distance.

\citet{Wildfowl271} report on the age composition and thereby breeding
success of Whitefront flocks wintering in England that originate from
around the Barents Sea. Low variation in annual brood size (3.24)
accompanies a 0.33 proportion of first-winter geese. Peak breeding
success seemed to be between the ages of three and seven. The phenology
of Whitefronts is presented, including that from Kolguyev.

\citet{kondratyev2008greater} have the most recent breeding data
for geese on Kolguyev, and seem to be the best source on the presence,
movements and condition of different age and social classes of Whitefronts
on the island. They find that while the population of Whitefronts
has held steady, that of Bean Geese (\emph{A. fabalis}) and goose
predators has increased since 1995. Predation on a non-lemming island
is posited as a cause for failed breeders to move farther north east
to areas with fewer predators.

\citet{jonsson2008lesser} studied Lesser Snow Geese (\emph{Chen}
\emph{caerulescens} \emph{caerulescens}) and the smaller Ross' Geese
(\emph{C. rossii}) and posited that larger goose species were likelier
to maintain family groups in winter, and that this conferred benefits
when antagonistically encountering the smaller species over resource
patches. Mixed-species flocking accrued benefits to both, but Ross'
Geese had a clear subordinate social status, and preferred larger
groups over the maintenance of families.

\citet{10.2307/4511184} document the reformation of family groups
after the single release of Whitefronts, and note that this cohesion
is common to other genera of geese as well.

\citet{OIK:OIK12114} reported some of the data on satellite tracked
Whitefronts of the Greenland subspecies (\emph{A. a. flavirostris})
wintering in the British Isles, and correlated the onset of migration
with assisting tailwinds.

\citet{IBI:IBI151} posit that the most likely reason for association
between first-year non-breeding birds and adult breeding pairs was
the increased foraging time afforded to each party by distribution
of vigilance costs. Alloparental care if present was posited to be
in the form of parent-offspring relationships and to confer better
nest defence.

\citet{10.2307/4088245} similarly note guiding of first-winter offspring,
teaching foraging and social skills and the locations of feeding and
roosting sites as common explanations for the extended relationships
between parents and offspring in Whitefronts.

\citet{wilson1991winter} discuss winter site fidelity in the Greenland
subspecies of Whitefront. They reported that around 85\% of birds
were observed at the same sites over successive winters, and that
within each winter, negligibly few geese moved between sites. Overall,
this points to extreme site fidelity in the population, if not the
species, and could explain why no neat correlations can be drawn between
winter site conditions and family size. Such site fidelity would have
to be looked for in banded geese in the Netherlands.
