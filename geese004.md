# Turbines and geese

In Denmark, Larsen and Madsen (2000) describe 100m and 200m buffers around wind turbines placed in lines and clusters respectively, within which wintering Pink-footed goose (A. brachyrhynchus) dropping density did not reach 50% of the maximum. Surveying turbines in the same study site in 2008, Madsen and Boertmann (2008) concluded that since the avoidance buffer calculated in the same way as before was reduced to 40m in places, geese had become habituated to the presence of turbines. Their caveat was that industry standards for turbines have since grown in both height and rotor sweep, which might lead to a retention of avoidance behaviour with larger turbines.
Questions relating to settlements are similar to those for turbines. The logic is that geese will avoid areas with frequent human activity. Farmland near settlements was seen to be used by large flocks of geese, but settlements themselves were devoid of geese (not the case for introduced Canada geese, for example).

1. What do Ely and others mean when they refer to family size, especially when they state that flocks are agglomerations of many families? The issue is not one of concept but rather how it's measured. While it may indeed be true that flocks are made up of related individuals, if there's no way of distinguishing individuals into families, the variable can't really be measured.
