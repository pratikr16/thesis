\caption[Trends in family size]{Top row: Model fit and data with longitudinal position, days since first
autumn arrivals, predation index, and flock size as fixed effects.
Habitat type, observer, and breeding year are \emph{iid.} random
effects. Data used were complete cases of counts (\emph{n} = 34,174) of
successful families in flocks. Lines show partial fits for \textbf{(a)}
longitude, and \textbf{(b)} days since goose arrivals in autumn. Model
\(\Omega^{2}_0\) = 0.563. Bottom row: Model fit and data with
longitudinal position, days since first autumn arrivals, and predation
index as fixed effects. Individual identity and individual identity
nested within breeding year are random effects. Data used were all
families with marked geese (\emph{n} = 10,426), and a subset of only
successful families (\emph{n} = 3,102). Lines show partial fits for
\textbf{(c)} longitude, with all families (\emph{solid line}), and only
successful families (\emph{dashed line}), and \textbf{(d)} days since
arrivals. Model \(\Omega^{2}_0\) = 0.786, all families; \(\Omega^{2}_0\)
= 0.661, successful families. 95\% confidence intervals are shaded grey.
Lines (a,c) and arrows (b,d) mark longitudes and times of decreases in
GPS tracked families. Family initials included.}

\caption[Flocks: trends in size and composition]{Top row: Model fit and data for flock size with longitudinal position,\
days since first autumn arrivals, and summer predation as fixed effects. Data used were complete cases of flock counts (\emph{n} = 5,700). Lines show partial fits for \textbf{(a)} longitude, and \textbf{(b)} for days since goose arrivals in autumn . Model \(\Omega^{2}_0\) = 0.99. Bottom row: Model fit line and data for (c) number of families in flocks, with summer predation and longitude as fixed parametric effects and flock size as a smooth term, and breeding year, observer and habitat type as random effects. Data used were family frequency data from flock counts (\emph{n} = 837). Model \(\Omega^{2}_0\) = 0.99. Model fit and data for \textbf{(d)} family size with longitude, flock size, days since first autumn
arrivals, and summer predation as fixed effects. Data were family sizes from flock counts (\emph{n} = 34,174). Line shows partial fit for flock size. Model \(\Omega^{2}_0\) = 0.562. Habitat type, observer, and breeding year are \emph{iid.} random effects in both cases. 95\% confidence intervals are shaded grey.}

used were complete cases of flock counts (\emph{n} = 5,700). Model

Number of successful families in flocks with longitude, days since
autumn arrivals, flock size and summer predation as fixed effects. Data
used were family frequencies from flock counts (\emph{n} = 5,659). Model
\(\Omega^{2}_0\) = 0.99. \textbf{(d)} Family size with flock size,
longitude, days since arrivals and summer predation as fixed effects.
Data used were family sizes from flock counts (\emph{n} = 34,174), and
observations of individual geese (\emph{n} = 10,426). Model
\(\Omega^{2}_0\) = (\emph{1}) 0.661, successful families in flocks,

habitat type, and in \textbf{(d)}(\emph{1, 3}) are goose identity, and
goose identity nested within breeding year. Lines in \textbf{(a)},
\textbf{(b)} and \textbf{(c)} show partial fit for summer predation
index. Lines in \textbf{(d)} show partial fit of family sizes of

intervals are shaded grey.}
