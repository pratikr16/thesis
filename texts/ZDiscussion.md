We studied how the size of whitefront families is related to where, when and with how many flockmates they are seen in the wintering grounds. We found support for the effect of the size of successful families on how far they migrate from the breeding grounds, but only later in winter. Further, the number of successful families in flocks was higher in the west.
We also confirmed that family size decreases over the winter, but found that it is insensitive to flock size, and shows mixed responses to summer predation. Families are less likely to split later in winter, and with increasing family size. We found only indirect evidence that flights are responsible for family splits in winter.
We showed that flocks are smaller farther from the breeding grounds, and found that they increase in size over the winter. Additionally, larger flocks have more successful families. The proportion of first year birds in flocks is lower in larger flocks, but increases as winter progresses.

Social status has been found in previous studies to influence geese's selection of wintering sites, with dominant social units displacing subordinate ones from optimal wintering locations [@vangilder1985differential; @JOFO:JOFO087]. Our finding that larger families winter to the west of the study area would fit this pattern if the spatial distribution of whitefront families reflects habitat suitability. Geese can exploit most of the highly productive landscape and are very tolerant of human distrubance [@Koffijberg2017]. Any habitat selection is thus likely to be against conditions that impede foraging, such as snow and ice cover coupled with strong winds [@philippona1966geese]. Geese tolerate snow depths of ca. 15cm, conditions in excess of which are are not noted in the Netherlands before midwinter [@philippona1966geese]. Western areas near the North Sea coast may be expected to benefit from its moderating effect on temperature, with fewer instances of conditions that geese would prefer to avoid. This could explain why adults with juveniles would choose to winter there after midwinter.

Juvenile independence has been reported across goose taxa [eg. @prevett1980snow; @johnson1988weak; @black1989parent] as being concurrent with the arrival of spring. Previous studies have shown that spring copulation in the breeding pair triggers juvenile departure [@prevett1980snow; @fischer1965triumphgeschrei]. We find support for the hypothesis that the number of juveniles with adults decreases through the winter.
The dissociation of juveniles from parents should result in some families losing their only offspring, thus reducing the number of successful families counted in flocks over time. Our finding that the number of families seen in flocks increases with time contradicts this expectation. An explanation would be that social status predicts variation in spring migration timing, as it does the autumn arrival [@jongejans2015naar]. However, previous studies have not found such an effect [@madsen2001spring; @Bêty2004].

Our findings regarding the relation, or lack thereof, between family sizes and juvenile proportion and summer predation are at odds with previous studies which link breeding success in Arctic birds to the abundance of Arctic rodents [@angelstam1984role; @summers1986breeding; @summers1987factors; @blomqvist2002indirect etc.]. However, more recent studies indicate that since the 2000s, North Sea flyway whitefront breeding success no longer seems to be correlated with summer predation [@jongejans2015naar]. The causes for this effect are not well known. It is suggested that more whitefronts now breed on the lemming-free island of Kolguyev where they experience a constant level of predation [@kruckenberg2008white]. Further, it has been suggested that an expanded whitefront breeding range results in the entire population not being uniformly affected by predation, since lemming cycles are not expected to be synchronised across regions. This could allow whitefronts from low predation areas to have larger families than the mean, even as those facing increased predation do poorly [@jongejans2015naar]. A large breeding range also means that variation in predation pressure is lost due to year-wise averaging across the breeding range. This requires future models to account for the yearly summering site of families. Further, lemming cycles are in northern Russia appear to be faltering overall and this could also explain why cyclicity in goose breeding success is reduced [@nolet2013faltering]. @angerbjorn2001geographical found that the cyclicity of lemming populations in Fennoscandia has been previously disrupted and re-established in the later-19th and 20th centuries. This lends support to the idea that northern Russian lemming cyclicity might be undergoing similar temporary disruption, following which they could be restored.

The increase in marked geese's family size with the level of predation could suggest that facing high predation pressure, geese either fledge large families or fail entirely. This could be the case if geese more effective at repelling predators also have higher fecundity. Body size may be an important driver. Larger emperor geese *A. canagica* and whitefronts are better than smaller species at defending clutches [@thompson1987emperor], and larger black brent and lesser snow geese have higher fecundity than smaller ones [@ECY:ECY19957682404; @davies1988body].
We posit that migration mortality might also be a significant factor in the decoupling of family size and summer predation. We found that in 2016, families of geese observed approx. one month pre-migration on Kolguyev were significantly larger (mean = 2.25) than successful families (dataset *B*, mean = 1.72) (GLM, z = -4.285, p < 0.001) and all families of marked geese (dataset *C*, mean = 0.46) (GLM, z = -14.511, p < 0.001) recorded in the first two months following their arrival on the wintering grounds.

Bird migration is strictly constrained by metabolic factors. Energy reserves and water balance especially determine how far and how fast a bird can fly, and thus where it must stop-over, and by extension, terminate migration [@Klaassen57]. Our finding that flocks are smaller to the west of the wintering area (approx. 3 - 4°E) fit well in this context, and it is to be expected that fewer geese would choose to winter farther west when sites to the east are suitable.
Our results that larger flocks had a lower proportion of first-year birds must be considered in the context of the previous outcome that larger families winter in the west, where flocks are smaller and have more successful families. This likely results in a higher juvenile proportion from small flocks, producing the trend we see.
Consequently, one would expect a higher proportion of juveniles in westerly flocks, but we did not find that flock juvenile proportion varies over the study site. This is contrary to the expectation that goose families selecting for optimal sites drive variation in juvenile proportion over wintering areas [eg. @JOFO:JOFO087]. However, independent juveniles observed in wintering flocks [eg. @hanson1953dominance; @gregoire1990agonistic; @JANE:JANE325] may dampen any variation.

The result that flock juvenile proportion rises non-linearly over the winter is in line with the previous finding that the number of successful families in flocks increases with time. However, this trend may be due in larger part to whitefronts being age-differentially migratory, with pairs without young leaving the breeding grounds earlier than families and juveniles. An effect of age on spring departure timing has been unsuccessfully sought for in similar species [snow geese, @Bêty2004; pink-footed geese @madsen2001spring]. In snow geese, the continued influx of juveniles to the breeding grounds for some weeks after the arrival of the breeding population does suggest that independent juveniles follow a different migration schedule [@prevett1980snow]. The question of age-differential migration would ideally be resolved with age-ratios of flocks on spring migration. The population likely does not receive an influx of juveniles towards the end of winter, leading us to conclude that juveniles do indeed leave later than adults in spring.

Finally, our findings that daily split probability decreases with the distance travelled, and is reduced later in winter are largely novel. They contradict the consensus that geese become independent towards spring [@prevett1980snow; @johnson1988weak; @black1989parent; @scheiber2013social]. We also did not differentiate between juvenile separation, juvenile death, and separation of breeding pair in our analysis, and this coupled with our low sample size of 13 families could have biased the results.
Nonetheless, our results that the number of flights undertaken by a family were a good predictor of whether it would split are in accordance with the idea that flights are disruptive events that contribute to separation [@prevett1980snow]. As we have found, one would expect that in such scenarios larger families are easier to locate and cohere to. The positive relation between the probability of splitting at each half hour and the time since the last take-off is best ascribed to a very low sample size of 6 families in which only 8 splits were recorded.

The results we obtained add significantly to our knowledge of greater white-fronted geese. Whitefront families likely leverage their dominance to occupy optimal sites as winter progresses. Simultaneously, they undergo a steady reduction in the number of associated juveniles. Our findings show that young split off from families earlier than previously thought in this species in which families are thought to remain together throughout the winter, and sometimes longer than a year [@10.2307/4088245; @ely1979breeding; @kruckenberg2005young]. Remaining on the wintering grounds later than other social classes, families and independent juveniles make this population differentially migratory by both age and social status. Previous authors [@madsen2001spring; @Bêty2004] have sought such an effect, and we present it as a novel finding for geese. This should prompt a rethink in hunting policy, especially of when the season reopens, since families and juveniles tend to cluster and are already over-represented in hunting bags [@Madsen2010].
