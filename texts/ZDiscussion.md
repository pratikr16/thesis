We studied how the size of whitefront families is related to where, when and with how many flockmates they are seen in the wintering grounds. The size of successful families was not a determinant of where they were seen in the first two months after the arrival of the population in autumn, but in the remaining period, larger families were found farther to the west (Fig. 2). This is at odds with the pattern in black brent geese, in which more dominant social units winter at sites closer to the breeding areas [@vangilder1985differential]. It further suggests that the point of arrival of geese on the wintering grounds is controlled by extrinsic factors such as weather or flock heading, and that an assortment period is required before they settle on long-term wintering areas, to which they can be quite faithful [@wilson1991winter].

A decrease in family sizes over time was seen in all our datasets, indicating a swift reduction in the strength of bonds (Fig. 3a). A contrasting trend of multi-year bonds is well known from the Greenland subspecies *flavirostris*, and has been recorded in the Pacific subspecies *frontalis* [@10.2307/4088245, @ely1979breeding], but we were not able to quantify these from our data.
Family fission probability showed a positive relationship with time since the last flight, going against the expectation that fission is a circumstance forced by sudden flight. Hour of day was also not a significant predictor of splits, and this may indicate that families maintain contact by means other than visual, and vocalisations are a method used by geese to locate families in flocks when separated @prevett1980snow. Further, the low sample size (*n* = 8) could have biased results.

The size of successful families was unaffected by the level of summer predation. By contrast, marked geese had larger families in years with high summer predation. This difference in trends could be based in the inclusion of unsuccessful families among marked geese.
The increase in family size with predation levels could be explained if goose pairs suffer total clutch loss during high predation years, resulting in the survival of families that are naturally larger. This might result if geese more effective at repelling predators also have higher fecundity. Larger emperor geese *A. canagica* and whitefronts are better than smaller species at defending clutches [@10.2307/4087283], and larger black brent and lesser snow geese have higher fecundity than smaller ones [@ECY:ECY19957682404, @davies1988body], lending this idea some support.
Migration mortality might also be a significant factor in the decoupling of family size and summer predation. We found that in 2016, families of geese observed ca. one month pre-migration on Kolguyev were significantly larger than successful ($z$ = -4.285, $p$ = 1.83 $\times$ 10^-5^0) and all ($z$ = -14.511, $p <$ = 2 $\times$ 10^-16^0) families recorded in the first two months following their arrival on the wintering grounds.

Flock size decreased with distance from the breeding grounds, as would be expected from a simple distance - energy expenditure relationship. Larger flocks contained more families, conforming to early ideas of how migratory goose flocks form [@elder1949role]. The proportion of first winter birds in flocks decreased with flock size. Combined with smaller flocks and larger families in the west, this lends support to the hypothesis that more successful families winter in smaller flocks. Such flocks would have higher relatedness, allowing competition costs to be balanced by the benefits of association with kin [@HAMILTON19641]. Juvenile proportion also increased as winter progressed, further supporting the position that family bonds weaken over time. We suggest the population is age-differentially migratory, with adults likely leaving before immature juveniles to reap the breeding benefits of early arrival in the Arctic.

The proportion of juveniles was unaffected by the level of summer predation. The proximate explanation is that there is very little variance in predation index between years. Ultimately, this may reflect that whitefronts nest across a large enough geographic range that predation pressure is largely constant over time. Further, it is suggested that as lemming cycles falter with climate change, there has been a homogenisation of predation levels across the Arctic [@nolet2013faltering]. This is in line with findings in @jongejans2015naar, which suggest that since the 1990s, breeding success in North Sea whitefronts has been decoupled from lemming abundance, even as the Pannonian population continues to respond.

Some issues remain which we have not been able to explore with the current data. How families choose their wintering sites waits on families of varying sizes being fitted with GPS loggers on the breeding grounds and tracked along the autumn migration. We suggest that pairs with juveniles select sites with lower probabilities of snow, which are farther west in coastal areas. Since snow cover is insubstantial until mid-winter, this could also explain the two months families take to select wintering sites. Another dynamic that merits study is noted by @jonsson2008lesser wherein the maintenance of family bonds is contingent on the species' dominance rank in a mixed-species flock. We expect that in such flocks the family sizes of the smaller species will be predicted by the probability of a family winning contests against the median social unit of the heterospecific. Finally, the proximate mechanisms underlying family fission remain of particular interest. Both parents and offspring stand to gain from continued association over a number of years. Indeed, conditions favour large, extended families. We suggest that splits are akin to abrupt regime shifts that are well studied in very different systems [for example @kefi2014early], and could be similarly predicted given data from a sufficient number of families.
