Flock count data from 16 breeding years and subsequent winters yielded a mean 420 flock counts per year (range: 67 (2001) - 672 (2005)). Except one record in August 2016, Aprils (n = 24) and Septembers (n = 76) had the fewest records, with most observations from October - January (81%, n = 5,785). Observations declined over February (11%) and March (6.8%). The mean flock size was 712 (range: 2 - 20,000), with a mean proportion of first-winter birds of 0.18 (range: 0 - 0.87). Flocks in which families were held on average 540 birds (range: 3 - 11,000), in which the mean number of juveniles in families was 1.78 (range: 1 - 10). On average, 626 marked geese (range: 62 - 1143) were observed each year, accompanied by 0.59 juveniles (range: 0 - 11)

Families fitted with GPS loggers travelled 11 km per day (range: 0 - 306). At the daily scale, we defined flights as movements of above 1000 metres. Families flew a mean of twice (range: 0 - 10) per day, and 98 times (range: 63 - 367) over the tracking period.
In 2016 families take-offs occurred on average 5 times (range: 1 - 15) times a day, and 470 times (range: 328 - 659) over the tracking period. 21 family splits occurred and were not restricted to juveniles.
Geese began to arrive between September 26 and October 30, and the last geese left between March 03 and April 01, resulting in a mean goose winter of 165 days.
Lemming abundance from the breeding grounds transformed into a predation index ranged between 1.17 and 1.9, with very low variance between years (σ^2^ = 0.048).

## Juveniles and wintering site choice

We found no influence of the number of juveniles in a family on how far from the breeding grounds a family wintered in the first sixty days after arrival (dataset *B*: successful families in flocks, and *C*: families of marked geese, model *1*, χ^2^ B = 1.135, p B = 0.286, χ^2^ C = 2.007, p C = 0.157, see Fig.2). Later in the winter, larger families from dataset *B* (successful families in flocks) wintered farther west (χ^2^ = 4.194, p = 0.041), while dataset *C* (families of marked geese) did not reveal any influence of juvenile number on wintering site (χ^2^ = 0.27, p = 0.6033). In all cases, geese were found farther west with increasing number of days since arrival (χ^2^ = 116.5641, p < 0.001, see Fig.2).

## Family size in winter

The number of juveniles in a family (dataset *B*: successful families in flocks, model *2.a*) decreased through the winter (χ^2^ = 74.166, p < 0.001, see Fig.3), but was insensitive to flock size (χ^2^ = 0.270, p = 0.6033) and summer predation (χ^2^ = 0.337, p = 0.562, see Fig.4).
Family sizes of marked geese (dataset *C*: families of marked geese, model *2.a* adapted) decreased over time (χ^2^ = 19.936, p = < 0.001, see Fig.3), but showed an increase with the level of summer predation (χ^2^ = 12.935, p < 0.001, see Fig.4).
We tested whether the exclusion of unsuccessful pairs from family counts in flocks biased the data by similarly excluding such records from observations of marked geese. We confirmed this bias in sampling method by failing to find any effect of summer predation after excluding unsuccessful pairs from data *C* (χ^2^ = 0.1321, p = 0.716, see Fig.4).
The number of successful families in flocks increased with flock size (χ^2^ = 7162, p < 0.001, see Fig.5), and the number of days since goose arrival in autumn (χ^2^ = 171.3, p < 0.001, see Fig.6), but was unaffected by summer predation (χ^2^ = 0, p = 0.98). Further, there were more successful families in flocks farther from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 12.73, p = 0.0004, see Fig.7).

## Flock size in winter

Flocks were significantly smaller farther from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 66599, p = < 0.001, see Fig.8), and grew slightly over the winter (χ^2^ = 4975, p < 0.001).
Within flocks, juvenile proportions increased through the winter (χ^2^ = 19.43, p = 0.001, see Fig.9), and decreased with increasing flock size (χ^2^ = 5.921, p = 0.015), but did not show any effect of distance from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 1.015, p = 0.314), or of summer predation (χ^2^ = 0.021, p = 0.883).

## Probability of family splits

The daily probability of families separating (see Fig.10) was significantly lower later in the winter (χ^2^ = 8.314, p = 0.004), and lower in larger families (χ^2^ = 11.41, p < 0.001). There was no effect of the daily number of flights (χ^2^ = 0.018, p = 0.893), nor the daily distance moved (χ^2^ = 2.99, p = 0.083). Split probability was higher in families that made cumulatively more flights over the period leading up to the split (χ^2^ = 143.23, p < 0.001), but decreased in families that moved a shorter cumulative distance over the days leading up to splits (χ^2^ = 182.63, p < 0.001). At the half-hour scale, split probability increased with time since the previous take-off (χ^2^ = 6.07, p = 0.014), but was not related to the distance travelled in the previous half hour (χ^2^ = 0.389, p = 0.533).
