After filtering census data (*A, B, C*) (mapped in Fig.1), we obtained 7,149 flock counts from 75 observers at 123 geocoded sites. Of these, 1,884 flocks counted by 17 observers at 64 sites yielded 51,037 successful families. A further 10,635 marked geese were observed at 8,416 sites. We could not obtain data on the habitat type, flock size, and observer identity for these records.

Half-hourly positions from 64 individual geese (13 adult pairs, 38 juveniles) in 13 families were recorded in the winters of 2013 (n = 3), 2014 (n = 4), and 2016 (n = 6). 2016 families carried accelerometer coupled position loggers which recorded 0.5 Hz flight bursts. On average, families were tracked for 78 days (range: 34 - 135), travelling 11 km per day (range: 0 - 306). At the daily scale, we defined flights as movements of above 1000 metres. Families flew a mean of twice (range: 0 - 10) per day, and 98 times (range: 63 - 367) over the tracking period.
For 2016 families, we identified true flight activity, which occurred on average 5 times (range: 1 - 15) times a day, and 470 times (range: 328 - 659) over the tracking period. 21 family splits occurred and were not restricted to juveniles.

Flock flight intensity records from 84 spring and 180 autumn sites (overlap = 72) yielded 6,266 days of data. Geese began to arrive between September 26 and October 30, and the last geese left between March 03 and April 01, resulting in a mean goose winter of 165 days.
Lemming abundance from the breeding grounds transformed into a predation index ranged between 1.17 and 1.9, with very low variance between years (σ^2^ = 0.048).

As seen in Fig.2, we found no influence of the number of juveniles in a family on how far from the breeding grounds a family wintered in the first sixty days after arrival (datasets *B* and *C*, model *1*, χ^2^ B = 1.135, p B = 0.286, χ^2^ C = 2.007, p C = 0.157). Later in the winter, larger families from dataset *B* wintered farther west (χ^2^ = 4.194, p = 0.041), while dataset *C* did not reveal any influence of juvenile number on wintering site (χ^2^ = 0.27, p = 0.6033). In all cases, geese were found farther west later in the winter (χ^2^ = 116.5641, p = 2×10^-16^).

The number of juveniles in a family (dataset *B*, model *2.a*) was insensitive to flock size (χ^2^ = 0.270, p = 0.6033) and summer predation (χ^2^ = 0.337, p = 0.562), but decreased through the winter (χ^2^ = 74.166, p = 2×10^-16^).
Family sizes of marked geese (dataset *C*) decreased over time (χ^2^ = 19.936, p = 8.01 × 10^-6^.), but showed an increase with the level of summer predation (χ^2^ = 12.935, p = 3.2 × 10^-4^).
We tested whether the exclusion of unsuccessful pairs from family counts in flocks biased the data by similarly excluding such records from observations of marked geese. We confirmed this bias in sampling method by failing to find any effect of summer predation after excluding unsuccessful pairs from data *C* (χ^2^ = 0.1321, p = 0.716, see Fig.3).
The number of successful families in flocks increased with flock size (χ^2^ = 7162, p = 2×10^-16^), and the number of days since goose arrival in autumn (χ^2^ = 171.3, p = 2×10^-16^, see Fig.4), but was unaffected by summer predation (χ^2^ = 0, p = 0.98). Further, there were more successful families in flocks farther from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 12.73, p = 0.0004, see Fig.5).

Flocks were significantly smaller farther from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 66599, p = 2 × 10^-16^, see Fig.6), and grew slightly over the winter (χ^2^ = 4975, p = 2 × 10^-16^).
Within flocks, juvenile proportions increased through the winter (χ^2^ = 19.43, p = 0.001, see Fig.7), and decreased with increasing flock size (χ^2^ = 5.921, p = 0.015), but did not show any effect of distance from the breeding grounds (χ^2^ = 1.015, p = 0.314), or of summer predation (χ^2^ = 0.021, p = 0.883). The same results were obtained using data published in @kokorev2002population (χ^2^ = 1.835, p = 0.175).

The daily probability of families separating (see Fig.8) was significantly lower later in the winter (χ^2^ = 8.314, p = 0.004), and lower in larger families (χ^2^ = 11.41, p = 7.32 × 10^-4^). There was no effect of the daily number of flights (χ^2^ = 0.018, p = 0.893), nor the daily distance moved (χ^2^ = 2.99, p = 0.083). Split probability was higher in families that made more flights in total (χ^2^ = 143.23, p = 2 × 10^-16^), but decreased in families that moved more overall (χ^2^ = 182.63, p = 2 × 10^-16^). At the half-hour scale, split probability increased with time since the previous flight (χ^2^ = 6.07, p = 0.014), but was not related to the distance travelled in the previous half hour (χ^2^ = 0.389, p = 0.533).
