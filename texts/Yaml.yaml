abstract: The ecology of migratory Arctic-breeding birds on their wintering grounds is affected both by intrinsic and external factors. Hypotheses of the interaction between family size, flock size, foraging site, and age-ratio of geese over the course of winter have emerged from field observations in western Europe, but are not well tested. We collected long-term observation data for flocks of wintering greater white-fronted geese *Anser albifrons albifrons* from the Netherlands and northern Germany, and tracked a total of 13 whole families of the species over three winters (2013, 2014, 2016) using GPS transmitters. Taking into account effects carried over from the summer, we explored how distance of the wintering site from breeding grounds on Kolguyev Island (69°N, 49°E), number of juveniles in a family, number of individuals in a flock, age-ratio of flocks, and time spent by geese on the wintering grounds are related. We related the probability of a family splitting to the number of times, and the distance that it flew. Families with more juveniles winter farther west after the first 60 days following autumn arrival, where flocks are smaller. The number of juveniles in a family, flock size, age-ratio and the number of families were well correlated with the number of days since arrival. Families that undertook more flights in winter were more likely to split. Our data suggest that juvenile white-fronted geese separate from their parents during the winter, and that this species is differentially migratory by age and social class in both autumn and spring.
