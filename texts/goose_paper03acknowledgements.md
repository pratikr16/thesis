Thanks to Yke van Randen who provided *geese.org* data, Gerard Troost who provided data from *trektellen.org*, the Dutch Association of Goose Catchers who caught goose families for tagging with GPS transmitters, and Helmut Kruckenberg and Peter Glazov who majorly contributed to the 2016 Kolguyev expedition which was funded by a National Geographic Society Grant to AK (GEFNE141-15).
