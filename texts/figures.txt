\caption{Wintering grounds of greater white-fronted geese \emph{Anser a.
albifrons} in the Netherlands and north-west Germany with sites
(dots, \emph{n} = 64) where successful families (\emph{n} = 51,037)
within flocks (\emph{n} = 1,884) were recorded. Diamonds mark fission
(\emph{n} = 19) in GPS tracked families (\emph{n} = 13). Shaded area bounds observations (\emph{n} = 10,635) of marked geese. Inset shows breeding grounds (ellipse) with Kolguyev (dot), and wintering grounds (rectangle). Data were collected from 2000 - 2016.}

Arrows show development of family size of GPS tracked geese. \emph{(b)} Predicted (lines) and mean (symbols) sizes of \emph{(1, empty triangles)} successful families of marked geese, \emph{(2, dots)} successful families in flocks, and \emph{(3, filled triangles)} all marked geese over summer predation levels. Arrival dates were calculated from flight activity data, and predation index from Arctic rodent abundance (see \emph{Methods}).}
