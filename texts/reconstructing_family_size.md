Mean family size reconstruction from juvenile percentage

Of the 5800 records available, only 1200 have family size data, ie, counts of the number of families of each size. Most records do have the number of juveniles and their percentage. It should be possible to reconstruct the mean family size from the juvenile percentage or count data, since it,s mostly families, and not single juveniles, that contribute most to the juvenile percentage in a flock.

The relationship between family size, number of families, and juvenile percentage needs to be examined, both across zones using the entire time series, and across years using the entire spatial scale, and finally, examined between years between zones.

There are likely to be the following confounding factors:
1. A higher juvenile percentage in the late winter reflecting the earlier departure of adults, including of parents of families that have split.
2. The fluctuation of juvenile percentages with the lemming cycle, resulting in a change in the mean family size.
3. The variation of juvenile percentages between zones between and within years.
