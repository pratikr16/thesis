\section{Datamap}\label{datamap}

Wintering grounds of greater white-fronted geese \emph{Anser a.
albifrons} in the Netherlands and north-west Germany with sites
(circles, \emph{n} = 64) where successful families (\emph{n} = 51,037)
within flocks (\emph{n} = 1,884) were recorded. Triangles mark fission
(\emph{n} = 19) in GPS tracked families (\emph{n} = 13). Area shaded
grey bounds observations (\emph{n} = 10,635) of marked geese. Data were
collected from 2000 - 2016.

\section{Distance \textasciitilde{} family
size}\label{distance-family-size}

Predicted distance of wintering site from breeding grounds on Kolguyev
for \emph{(a,b)} successful families in flocks, and \emph{(c,d)} marked
geese, within \emph{(a,c)} the first 60 days, and \emph{(b,d)} the
remainder of winter. Winter days were calculated from flight activity
data (see \emph{Methods}).

\section{Family trends}\label{family-trends}

Predicted size of \emph{(a)} successful families in flocks and
\emph{(b)} families of marked geese after arrival on the wintering
grounds. Predicted size of (\emph{c}) successful families in flocks over
flock size, and of \emph{(d)} \emph{1} successful families in flocks,
\emph{2} successful families of marked geese, and \emph{3} all marked
geese over summer predation levels. Arrival dates were calculated from
flight activity data, and predation index from Arctic rodent abundance
(see \emph{Methods}).

\section{Flock trends}\label{flock-trends}

Predicted \emph{(a)} flock size at distances from breeding grounds on
Kolguyev. Predicted proportion of first winter juveniles in relation to
\emph{(b)} flock size, \emph{(c)} days after arrival, and \emph{(d)}
summer predation index. Arrival dates were calculated from flight
activity data, and predation index from Arctic rodent abundance (see
\emph{Methods}).
