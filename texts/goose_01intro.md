# Introduction

Families are important components of animal groups, and among migratory waterfowl, are thought to underlie the formation of flocks [@elder1949role]. The maintenance of family bonds is advantageous in winter flocks, when families are dominant over pairs and singles [@Poisbleau20061351, @doi:10.1139/z03-049]. Their dominance increases with the number of juveniles, and confers access to better resources [@JANE:JANE325, @gregoire1990agonistic]. The need to teach juveniles to locate, select, and handle high quality foods may contribute to the continuation of such bonds over multiple breeding years [@10.2307/4088245]. The extension of parent-offspring bonds into spring is favoured in larger, less gregarious taxa [@10.2307/4088245] and increases the fitness of both parents and young [@black1989parent]. Parents likely benefit from the presence of nest-attending sub-adults from earlier broods who help in agonistic interactions, both against conspecifics [@conover2012delayed] and predators [@fox1988breeding].
Early studies of wintering geese indicated that access to a high-energy but unbalanced diet could cause family size to be on the decline despite an increase in overall population size [@boyd1969changes]. The populations of Arctic geese have since increased manifold [@fox2017a], but no corresponding work has investigated trends in family size either within or between years.

Long term marking and observations of greater white-fronted geese _Anser albifrons albifrons_ - hereon whitefronts - wintering in continental western Europe offer an opportunity to investigate current family dynamics of Arctic geese. From anecdotal accounts, it has been suggested that the Baltic-North Sea flyway population of whitefronts [@philippona1972blessgans] is differentially migratory, with more successful families migrating farther west than less successful ones. Further, these families are observed in smaller flocks, but flocks are also reportedly smaller in the west, setting up a number of interactions to explore. Determining the trend in the number of juveniles in families and as proportions of flocks over the winter is also important to assess the three main hypotheses.
The breeding success of Arctic-breeding birds is linked to the abundance of rodents, primarily lemmings _Lemmus spp._ and _Dicrostonyx spp._ [@summers1986breeding], and is predicted to be highest in years when lemming density is low and that of predators is high [@dhondt1987cycles]. The effect of summer predation on the proportion of first winter juveniles has been described in waders _Charadrii_ and dark-bellied brent geese _Branta bernicla bernicla_ wintering in Scandinavia [@summers1987factors, @blomqvist2002indirect] and in the Netherlands [@nolet2013faltering]. However, the mechanism by which predation pressue at the family level translates into population level effects is not well understood.
