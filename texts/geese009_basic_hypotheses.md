What are the hypotheses?

1. Flock size in wintering Whitefronts is predicted by the size and number of dominant social units.
 a. Families are dominant social units. Larger families are more dominant.
 b. Geese agglomerate to form flocks around indivisible social units, ie, families.
 c. This agglomeration has benefits:
  i. Reduced probability of predation.
  ii. Increased accuracy in decision making regarding resources.
 d. This agglomeration has costs:
  i. Scramble competition for depleting resources.
  ii. Agonistic interactions or interference competition from conspecifics.
 e. The decision of whether to join a flock is thus controlled by:
  i. The anti-predator benefit of joining a flock of size *n*.
  ii. The competition cost of joining a flock of size *n*.
  iii. The number of families in the flock.
  iv. The size of families in the flock.
  v. Other factors:
   * The time since leaving the previous flock.
   * The immediate energy requirement.
   * Weather conditions.
   * Predator presence.

Addition:

* Residence time on a field is a function of its forage quality.
* Residence time on a field is a function of the size of the social unit.
 - Large social units are less tolerant of resource depletion.
 - Large social units are more tolerant of reduced flock size.


2. Family size varies over the winter thus:
 a. Family size is lower than the whole winter mean in the first month.
  i. Flocks of breeding birds arrive later than non-breeding birds.
 b. Family size peaks in mid-winter.
  i. Recruitment to the wintering population is complete.
 c. Family size decreases from midwinter through to spring.
  i. Juveniles become independent.
  ii. Juveniles are subject to mortality.

3. The juvenile proportion of a flock varies over winter thus:
 a. Juvenile proportion is lower than the winter mean in the first month.
  i. Juveniles arrive with breeding birds and later than non-breeders.
 b. Juvenile proportion saturates by mid-winter.
  i. Recruitment to the wintering population is complete.
 c. Juvenile proportion rises above the winter mean in the last month before spring.
  i. Adults begin the spring migration earlier than first-winter juveniles.
