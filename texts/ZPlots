\caption{Wintering grounds of greater white-fronted geese \emph{Anser a.
albifrons} in the Netherlands and north-west Germany with sites
(dots, \emph{n} = 64) where successful families (\emph{n} = 51,037)
within flocks (\emph{n} = 1,884) were recorded. Diamonds mark fission
(\emph{n} = 19) in GPS tracked families (\emph{n} = 13). Shaded area bounds observations (\emph{n} = 10,635) of marked geese. 
Inset shows breeding grounds (ellipse) and wintering grounds (rectangle).Data were
collected from 2000 - 2016.}
