The size of successful families recorded in flocks was found to be unexpectedly insensitive to most predictors. The number of juveniles accompanying pairs increased slightly with longitudinal position, ie, from west to east, but not significantly (*p* = 0.874), but did, however, decrease significantly as expected through the winter ($p < 2x10^{-16}$). Individual observations showed a different trend; while not significant, there was a slight decrease in size from west to east (*p* = 0.244), and the number of juveniles seen with individuals also decreased over the winter ($p = 1.17x10^{-5}$).

As hypothesised, flocks were smaller in the west, and also tended to be larger the more days since the first autumn arrivals had passed ($p < 2x10^{-16}$). Consistent with the earliest ideas on how geese form flocks [@elder1949role], the number of families in flocks increased very rapidly with their size ($p < 2x10^{-16}$), but the size of successful families in flocks decreased slightly as flocks grew, but not significantly, (*p* = 0.257).
Further, the proportion of first winter juveniles in flocks was not affected significantly by their longitudinal position (*p* = 0.442). However, it increased significantly through the winter as expected (*p* = 0.00174). Larger flocks also had a lower proportion of juveniles than expected (_p_ = 0.015).

The effects of summer predation were not consistent across the levels of the population. The size of successful families in flocks increased, though not significantly, with the level of summer predation (*p* = 0.377), while the number of juveniles seen with marked geese was significantly decreased with high summer predation (*p* = 6.45x$10^{-6}$). The apparent difference in trends might be explained by the fact that only successful families were counted in flocks. The effect of summer predation on family size could be masked by such a sampling method, especially if higher levels of predation caused goose pairs to fail to fledge any young at all. On testing this idea by excluding observations of unsuccessful pairs from our analysis, we found a similar trend as that of the family data from flocks, though it was still not a significant one (*p* = 0.896). At a higher level, the number of successful families in flocks showed a marked decrease with the level of summer predation (*p* = 7.13x$10^{-16}$). This did not translate into a lower juvenile proportion (_p_ = 0.931), or decreased flock sizes(*p* = 0.308).

The goodness of fit of mixed models has not been easy to score. We examined a number of methods of calculating a traditional $R^2$, and settled on the $\Omega^{2}_0$ metric, which compares the residual variance of the full model against the residual variance of a (fixed) intercept-only null model [@SIM:SIM1572]. GAMs as implemented in `R` return an $R^2$ value.
