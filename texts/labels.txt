# Datamap

Map of the main wintering grounds of greater white-fronted geese *Anser a. albifrons* showing rivers & lakes (blue), with sites (crosses, n = 64) where families (n = 51,037) within flocks (n = 1,884) were recorded.
Triangles mark positions (n = 19) from 13 GPS tracked families of geese (3 in 2013, 4 in 2014, 6 in 2016) where families fissioned. Sites (n = 8,416) of marked goose observations (n = 10,635) are bounded by a kernel shaded grey. Observation data was collected from 2000 - 2017.

# Trends in family size

Top row: Model fit and data with longitudinal position, days since first autumn arrivals, predation index, and flock size as fixed effects. Habitat type, observer, and breeding year are *iid.* random effects. Data used were complete cases of counts (*n* = 34,174) of successful families in flocks. Lines show partial fits for **(a)** longitude, and **(b)** days since goose arrivals in autumn. Model $\Omega^{2}_0$ = 0.563. Bottom row: Model fit and data with longitudinal position, days since first autumn arrivals, and predation index as fixed effects. Individual identity and individual identity nested within breeding year are random effects. Data used were all families with marked geese (*n* = 10,426), and a subset of only successful families (*n* = 3,102). Lines show partial fits for **(c)** longitude, with all families (_solid line_), and only successful families (_dashed line_), and **(d)** days since arrivals. Model $\Omega^{2}_0$ = 0.786, all families; $\Omega^{2}_0$ = 0.661, successful families. 95% confidence intervals are shaded grey.
Lines (a,c) and arrows (b,d) mark longitudes and times of decreases in GPS tracked families. Family initials included.

# Trends in flocks

Top row: Model fit and data for flock size with longitudinal position, days since first autumn arrivals, and summer predation as fixed effects. Data used were complete cases of flock counts (*n* = 5,700). Lines show partial fits for **(a)** longitude, and **(b)** for days since goose arrivals in autumn . Model $\Omega^{2}_0$ = 0.99.
Bottom row: Model fit line and data for (c) number of families in flocks, with summer predation and longitude as fixed parametric effects and flock size as a smooth term, and breeding year, observer and habitat type as random effects. Data used were family frequency data from flock counts (*n*  = 837). Model $\Omega^{2}_0$ = 0.99. Model fit and data for **(d)** family size with longitude, flock size, days since first autumn arrivals, and summer predation as fixed effects. Data were family sizes from flock counts (*n* = 34,174). Line shows partial fit for flock size. Model $\Omega^{2}_0$ = 0.562. Habitat type, observer, and breeding year are *iid.* random effects in both cases 95% confidence intervals are shaded grey.

# Trends in juvenile proportion

Model fit and data for juvenile proportion with longitudinal position and summer predation as fixed effects, and days since first autumn arrivals as a smooth term. Data used were complete cases of flock age ratios (*n* = 5,659). Lines show partial fits for **(a)** days since arrivals, and **(b)** flock size.
Model $R^2$ = 0.104. 95% confidence intervals are shaded grey.

# Trends due to summer predation

Model fits and data for **(a)** flock size with longitude, days since first autumn arrivals, and summer predation as fixed effects. Data used were complete cases of flock counts (*n* = 5,700). Model $\Omega^{2}_0$ = 0.99.
**(b)** Juvenile proportion with flock size, longitude, and summer predation as fixed parametric effects, and days since arrivals as a smooth term. Data used were complete cases of flock age ratios (*n* = 5,659). Model $R^2$ = 0.104.
**(c)** Number of successful families in flocks with longitude, days since autumn arrivals, flock size and summer predation as fixed effects. Data used were family frequencies from flock counts (*n* = 5,659). Model $\Omega^{2}_0$ = 0.99.
**(d)** Family size with flock size, longitude, days since arrivals and summer predation as fixed effects. Data used were family sizes from flock counts (*n* = 34,174), and observations of individual geese (*n* = 10,426). Model $\Omega^{2}_0$ = (*1*) 0.661, successful families in flocks, (*2*) 0.563, successful pairs observed individually, and (*3*) 0.786, all pairs including unsuccessful ones observed individually. Random effects in **(a)**, **(b)** and **(c)** & **(d)**(*2*) are *iid.* breeding year, observer, and habitat type, and in **(d)**(_1, 3_) are goose identity, and goose identity nested within breeding year.
Lines in **(a)**, **(b)** and **(c)** show partial fit for summer predation index. Lines in **(d)** show partial fit of family sizes of (*1, 2, 3*) as described above for predation index. 95% confidence intervals are shaded grey.
