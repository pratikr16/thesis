# Introduction

Families are important components of animal groups. Find something here.


Among migratory waterfowl such as Canada geese _Branta canadensis_, family groups underlie the formation of flocks [@elder1949role]. The maintenance of family bonds is advantageous since families are dominant over pairs and singles [@Poisbleau20061351, @doi:10.1139/z03-049]. Family dominance rank increases with the number of juveniles, and larger families can win access to better resources [@JANE:JANE325, @gregoire1990agonistic]. The need to teach juveniles to locate, select, and handle high quality foods may contribute to the continuation of such bonds over multiple breeding years [@10.2307/4088245]. Within breeding years, however, the development of family size is not fully understood, and appears to be variable, with the retention of members favoured among larger taxa [@jonsson2008lesser, @10.2307/4088245]. Extended family bonds increase the fitness of both parents and young, with the presence of adults allowing offspring more uninterrupted feeding in winter [@black1989parent]. Parents benefit in summer from the presence of nest-attending sub-adults from earlier broods who help in herding young, and in agonistic interactions, both against conspecifics [@conover2012delayed] and predators [@fox1988breeding], boosting parental production [@black1989parent].

The likelihood of breeding success is also higher in birds that winter closer to their summer grounds [@schamber2001cross]. In Pacific black brent geese _Branta bernicla nigricans_, more juveniles winter closer to the breeding grounds [@JOFO:JOFO087], possibly because they are part of larger, more dominant families that can displace subordinate social units - unsuccessful pairs and singles - to more distant sites [@vangilder1985differential], but the influence of family size on wintering site selection is not well studied.
Any explanation of spatial and temporal variation in waterfowl family size in winter must take into account that the breeding success of Arctic birds is also strongly influenced by the abundance of rodents, primarily lemmings _Lemmus spp._ and _Dicrostonyx spp._ [@summers1986breeding], and is predicted to be highest in years when lemming density is low and that of predators is high [@dhondt1987cycles]. The effect of summer predation on the proportion of first winter juveniles has been described in waders _Charadrii_ and dark-bellied brent geese _Branta bernicla bernicla_ wintering in Scandinavia [@summers1987factors, @blomqvist2002indirect] and the Netherlands [@nolet2013faltering]. However, the mechanism by which predation pressure at the family level translates into population level effects is not well understood.

Greater white-fronted geese _Anser albifrons albifrons_, hereafter whitefronts, are the most populous goose species wintering in continental western Europe [@Fox2017a]. Long term observations of this species offer an interesting opportunity to investigate the dynamics of Arctic goose families over space and time. Accounts from the wintering grounds suggest that the Baltic-North Sea flyway population of whitefronts [@philippona1972blessgans] is differentially migratory, with more successful families wintering farther away from the breeding grounds than smaller ones. Further, these families are observed in smaller flocks, but flocks are also reportedly smaller in the west. Family bonds also reportedly weaken over a single winter, in contrast to the multi-year bonds of the Greenland subspecies _flavirostris_ [@10.2307/4088245]. These issues have received some attention [@jongejans2015naar], and set up a number of interactions to explore.
Here, we test the variation of family size in wintering geese along gradients of longitude, flock size, summer predation, and time since arrival, in order to better understand the population of the species.
