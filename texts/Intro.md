# Introduction

Living in groups entails both costs and benefits for animals. Group members benefit from more social interactions, and from the increased sensory and physical capabilities of the group [@krause2002living]. For instance, geese in larger flocks spend less time on the lookout for predators and have more time to feed [@roberts1996individual]. Among the costs of group living is the increased competition for limited resources in larger groups [@krause2002living]. Living in families offers all the benefits of groups, while costs are shared with relatives. Individuals may lose some direct fitness in family groups, but this is offset by the inclusive fitness gained from related group members [@HAMILTON19641; @rodman1981lions]. Thus animal societies composed of one or more families are common across taxa, from eusocial insects [@crozier1996evolution] to large herbivores [@Archie513], and cooperative carnivores [@MEC:MEC2071].

Many waterbirds, such as geese *Anserini*, live in groups composed of families. This is most apparent in winter, when families gather to form foraging and migratory flocks [@elder1949role]. Maintaining family bonds within flocks confers benefits since families are dominant over pairs and individuals. Family dominance rank increases with the number of members, for example in Canada geese *Branta canadensis* [@hanson1953dominance], snow geese *Anser caerulscens* [@gregoire1990agonistic], and barnacle geese *B. leucopsis* [@JANE:JANE325]. This allows larger families to occupy optimal foraging positions in flocks at lesser cost, and win access to better resources [@black1992foraging]. Both parents and offspring benefit from family bonds maintained across seasons, as juveniles gain access to more uninterrupted feeding in winter, and parents gain dominance rank [@black1989parent]. Parents of some species benefit in summer from the presence of nest-attending sub-adults [@fox1988breeding]; barnacle geese that are associated with their young through a winter, for example, are more likely to return with a brood the next year [@black1989parent].

From the summer breeding season, through autumn migration, on the wintering grounds, and often up to and beyond the return spring migration, goose family bonds are affected by a number of factors. A combination of weather conditions and levels of summer predation on the breeding grounds plays an important role in the success of a pair hatching and fledging young [@summers1986breeding; @dhondt1987cycles; @summers1987factors; @BÃªty2004]. The effect of summer predation linked to the abundance, or lack thereof, of lemmings and voles *Arvicolinae* has historically been significant enough in some species to be detectable at the population level in winter [@summers1987factors; @jongejans2015naar]. Autumn migration takes a further toll in long-distance migrants, especially on yearling birds [@owen1989survival; @francis1992survival].
In spring, juvenile geese become independent of parents [@prevett1980snow; @johnson1988weak; @black1989parent], being chased off in some species [@black1989parent; @poisbleau2008dominance]. However, some juveniles may remain associated with parents through the spring migration and on the breeding grounds, where they help fend off predators and competitors [@ely1979breeding].

The development of family bonds in winter, however, is not fully understood, and appears to be variable. Small species, such as Ross' geese *A. rossii*, show weak family bonds in winter, perhaps because these confer no dominance benefit against much larger snow geese with which they form mixed flocks [@jonsson2008lesser]. Similarly, cackling geese *B. hutchinsii* grazing in large, dense flocks show weak pair and family associations in winter which strengthen as they move to areas with fewer geese [@johnson1988weak].
In contrast, larger taxa such as giant Canada geese *B. canadensis maxima* and Greenland white-fronted geese *A. albifrons flavirostris* show strong, extended family bonds [@10.2307/4088245]. In general, small, grazing species tend to dissolve families in winter [@johnson1988weak], while large species that need to teach juveniles to locate and handle high quality foods tend to maintain them longer [@10.2307/4088245; @kruckenberg2005young].

The question of what space-use and movement decisions families make on the wintering grounds has also not been well explored, especially in the context of accompanying juveniles. Some effect is expected, since the flight of dark-bellied brent geese *Branta b. bernicla* on autumn migration is affected by the presence of juveniles [@JAV:JAV310213]. Like other birds, geese can be differentially migratory with different population classes occupying different wintering areas [@cristol1999differential]. For example, the white and blue morphs of snow geese show longitudinal separation during migration [@cooke1975gene]. Further, more juveniles of Pacific black brent geese *B. b. nigricans* winter closer to the breeding grounds [@JOFO:JOFO087]. However, how the number of juveniles in a family influences where it winters is not well understood.

Though the maintenance of family bonds in geese is beneficial, separation of juveniles from parents is the norm. The mechanistic causes underlying family separation are not well studied.
In wintering snow geese, family separation is held to be caused by a lack of coordination between members during chaotic take-offs in large flocks, and is thus seen as accidental [@prevett1980snow]. Separated birds attempt to locate their families, and similar behaviour is observed in Canada geese [@elder1949role]. Investigating the role of flight events in family size dynamics requires accurate, fine-scale knowledge of individual positions, and obtaining such data for whole families of highly mobile species has historically presented challenges.

Greater white-fronted geese *Anser albifrons albifrons*, hereafter white-fronted geese, are among the most abundant geese wintering in continental western Europe [@madsen1999goose], and offer an interesting opportunity to investigate the wintertime dynamics of goose families. Accounts suggest that in the Baltic-North Sea flyway population of white-fronted geese [@philippona1972blessgans], larger families winter farther west than smaller ones. Further, these families are observed in smaller flocks, but this may be an artefact of smaller flocks being observed farther west. Family bonds reportedly weaken within winters, contrary to the trend for families of large taxa to stay together through the winter, and sometimes beyond [@10.2307/4088245; @kruckenberg2005young].
We draw on long-term field observations and high frequency GPS tracks of whole families of white-fronted geese from their wintering grounds in the Netherlands and northern Germany [@mooij1991numbers; @madsen1999goose; @fox2010current] to test the hypotheses that: *1.* Larger families winter to the west, farther from the breeding grounds *2.* Larger families winter in smaller flocks, *3.* Families decrease in size over the winter, *4.* Family size in winter shows effects carried over from summer predation and autumn migration, and *5.* Family separation is predicted by the number and frequency of flights, and the time since take-off.
