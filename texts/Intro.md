# Introduction

Families are important components of animal groups. Living in groups entails both costs and benefits for individuals. Group members benefit from more social interactions, and from the increased sensory and physical capabilities of the group [@krause2002living]. For example, geese in larger flocks spend less time on the lookout for predators and have more time to feed [@roberts1996individual]. Among the costs of group living is the increased competition for limited resources in larger groups [@krause2002living]. Living in families offers all the benefits of groups, while costs are shared with relatives. Animals may lose some direct fitness in family groups, but this is offset by the inclusive fitness gained from related group members [@HAMILTON19641; @rodman1981lions]. Thus animal societies composed of one or more families are common across taxa: from eusocial insects [@crozier1996evolution] to large herbivores [@Archie513] and cooperative carnivores [@MEC:MEC2071].

Waterfowl such as geese also live in groups composed of families. This is most apparent in winter, when families gather to form migratory flocks [@elder1949role]. Maintaining family bonds within flocks confers benefits since families are dominant over pairs and individuals, and family dominance rank increases with the number of members, for example in Canada geese *Branta canadensis* [@hanson1953dominance], snow geese *Anser caerulscens* [@gregoire1990agonistic], and barnacle geese *B. leucopsis* [@JANE:JANE325]. This allows larger families to occupy optimal foraging positions in wintering flocks at lesser cost, and win access to better resources [@black1992foraging]. Both parents and offspring benefit from family bonds maintained across seasons. Juveniles gain access to more uninterrupted feeding in winter [@black1989parent], while parents benefit in summer from the presence of nest-attending sub-adults [@fox1988breeding]. Barnacle geese that are associated with their young through a winter, for example, are more likely to return with a brood the next year [@black1989parent].

The development of family bonds within a winter is, however, not fully understood, and appears to be variable. Small species, such as Ross' geese *A. rossii* show weak family bonds in winter, perhaps because these confer no dominance benefit against much larger snow geese with which they form mixed flocks [@jonsson2008lesser]. Similarly, cackling geese *B. hutchinsii* show weak pair and family associations in winter likely because they graze in large, dense flocks with high levels of disturbance. As cackling geese move to areas with less disturbance prior to spring migration, pair bonds strengthen [@johnson1988weak].
In contrast, larger taxa such as giant Canada geese *B. canadensis maxima* and Greenland white-fronted geese *A. albifrons flavirostris* show strong, extended family bonds [@10.2307/4088245]. In general, small, grazing species tend to dissolve families in winter [@johnson1988weak], while large species that need to teach juveniles to locate and handle high quality foods tend to maintain them [@10.2307/4088245, @kruckenberg2005young].

Preferences for patchily distributed energy-rich foods can make geese faithful to wintering sites [@wilson1991winter]. How accompanying juveniles influence where families winter is not well understood. For instance, juvenile dark-bellied brent geese *Branta b. bernicla* undertaking the autumn migration with parents affect their flight speed, so some effect is expected [@JAV:JAV310213]. Like other birds, geese can be differentially migratory with different population classes occupying different wintering areas [@cristol1999differential]. For example, the white and blue morphs of snow geese show longitudinal separation during migration [@cooke1975gene]. Further, more juveniles of Pacific black brent geese *B. b. nigricans* winter closer to the breeding grounds [@JOFO:JOFO087]. However, the question of what space-use decisions adult geese make when leading related juveniles on migration has not been well explored.

Though the maintenance of family bonds in geese is beneficial, separation of juveniles from parents is the norm among geese. Juveniles leave the family as spring approaches [@prevett1980snow; @johnson1988weak; @black1989parent]. In the smaller *Branta* geese, parents become increasingly aggressive towards young and intentionally chase them off [@black1989parent; @poisbleau2008dominance]. This is also reported in larger greylag geese *A. anser* [@scheiber2013social].
However, family splits in winter are not well studied. In wintering snow geese, family separation is held to be caused by a lack of coordination between members during chaotic take-offs in large flocks, and is thus seen as accidental [@prevett1980snow]. Separated birds attempt to locate their families, and similar behaviour is observed in Canada geese [@elder1949role]. Investigating the role of flight events in family size dynamics requires accurate, fine-scale knowledge of individual positions, and obtaining such data for whole families of highly mobile species has historically presented challenges.

Observational studies of goose family sizes must account for summer conditions on the breeding grounds. Rodent abundance cycles - primarily of lemmings _Lemmus spp._ and _Dicrostonyx spp._ - have a significant impact on the breeding success of Arctic birds. Lemmings have 3 - 4 year cycles of abundance, with 'peak' years of high density followed by 'crash' years of scarcity. Arctic predators preferentially target lemmings and shift to bird eggs and young as alternative prey when lemmings are scarce [@angelstam1984role]. This effect is most pronounced when a lemming peak is followed by a crash: predation pressure on geese increases as predators multiply in the peak year and then target birds in the crash year [@dhondt1987cycles]. This causes marked decreases in the proportion of first winter juveniles in both waders _Charadrii_ and geese wintering in Europe [@summers1987factors]. However, the mechanism by which predation pressure at the family level translates into population level effects is not well understood.

Greater white-fronted geese _Anser albifrons albifrons_, hereafter whitefronts, are among the most populous geese wintering in continental western Europe [@Fox2017a], and offer an interesting opportunity to investigate the wintertime dynamics of goose families. Accounts suggest that in the Baltic-North Sea flyway population of whitefronts [@philippona1972blessgans], larger families winter farther west than smaller ones. Further, these families are observed in smaller flocks, but this may be an artefact of smaller flocks observed farther west. Family bonds reportedly weaken within winters, contrary to the trend expected for large geese [@10.2307/4088245, @kruckenberg2005young].
We draw on long-term field observations and high frequency GPS tracks of whole families of whitefronts from their wintering grounds in the Netherlands and northern Germany [@mooij1991numbers] to test the hypotheses that: *1.* Larger families winter to the west, further from the breeding grounds *2.* Larger families winter in smaller flocks, *3.* Families decrease in size over the winter, *4* Family size in winter is dependent on summer predation pressure, and *5* Family separation is predicted by the number, frequency, and time since take-off.
