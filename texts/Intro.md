# Introduction

Families are important components of animal groups. In the most extreme case, eusocial insect colonies are composed entirely of related individuals [@crozier1996evolution]. Preference for kin holds in more complex vertebrates as well. For example, African savannah elephants *Loxodonta africana* living in unstable matriarchal fission-fusion societies prefer to remain part of a smaller 'core' group of their direct female relatives when larger groups split [@Archie513]. Inclusive fitness through kin selection is posited as the basis for cooperation within groups [@HAMILTON19641]. However, spotted hyaena *Crocuta crocuta* clans which cooperate in risky behaviours such as hunting and conflict may also contain matrilines with low inter-relatedness [@MEC:MEC2071].

Among waterfowl such as Canada geese _Branta canadensis_, family groups underlie the formation of migratory flocks [@elder1949role], and family membership confers benefits. For example, in tundra swans *Cygnus columbianus* and barnacle geese *B. leucopsis*, the maintenance of family bonds in wintering flocks is advantageous since families are dominant over pairs and singles [@doi:10.1139/z03-049, @Poisbleau20061351]. Family dominance rank increases with the number of juveniles in snow *Anser caerulescens* and barnacle geese [@gregoire1990agonistic, @JANE:JANE325], and larger families of barnacle geese can occupy optimal foraging positions within flocks at lesser cost, thereby winning access to better resources [@black1992foraging]. The development of family bonds over the winter is not fully understood, and appears to be variable. Larger taxa such as giant Canada geese *B. canadensis maxima* appear to maintain family bonds longer [@10.2307/4088245], while smaller Ross' *A. rossii* and cackling geese *B. hutchinsii* show only weak family associations in winter [@johnson1988weak, @jonsson2008lesser].

Geese can show high fidelity to wintering sites and food type [@wilson1991winter], and the need for geese to teach juveniles to locate and handle high quality foods may contribute to the continuation of parent-offspring bonds over multiple breeding years [@10.2307/4088245].
When maintained, extended family bonds increase the fitness of both parents and young, with the presence of adults allowing barnacle geese more uninterrupted feeding in winter [@black1989parent]. Parents benefit in summer from the presence of nest-attending sub-adults from earlier broods who help in herding young, and in agonistic interactions, both against conspecifics [@conover2012delayed] and predators [@fox1988breeding]. This increases the chance of parents associated with their young in winter returning with young the following year [@black1989parent].

Since family splits are simultaneously disadvantageous and reportedly the norm, their ultimate evolutionary and proximate behavioural causes are not well known. At the proximate level, snow goose families are hypothesised to split on the wintering grounds when abrupt threat-induced flights prevent pre-flight coordination between members. Separated birds either remain airborne or systematically search nearby flocks until a family member is seen [@prevett1980snow]. It is now possible to investigate these hypotheses using high frequency GPS data.

Studies of family size at winter sites must take into account that waterfowl, like many birds, are often differentially migratory, with population classes selecting different wintering sites [@cristol1999differential]. Segregation on the basis of sex along latitude is well studied  in ducks [@leopold1919differential, @nichols1980sex, @carbone1995differential]. Among the geese, Pacific black brent geese *Branta bernicla nigricans* with a greater likelihood of breeding success were found wintering closer to their summer grounds [@schamber2001cross]. Further, more juveniles of the species winter closer to the breeding grounds [@JOFO:JOFO087], as do more dominant social units [@vangilder1985differential]. Brent geese migrate in families, and the presence of juveniles is expected to affect the flight of adults [@JAV:JAV310213]. Within this context, it is not clear how the number of juveniles accompanying a pair on autumn migration influences where they will winter.

Any variation in goose family size must include the effect of the summer abundance of rodents, primarily lemmings _Lemmus spp._ and _Dicrostonyx spp._, on the breeding success of Arctic birds [@angelstam1984role]. Geese are predicted to be least successful in years when lemming density is low and that of predators is high [@dhondt1987cycles]. This lowering effect of summer predation on the proportion of first winter juveniles has been described in both waders _Charadrii_ and dark-bellied brent geese _Branta bernicla bernicla_ wintering in Scandinavia [@summers1987factors, @blomqvist2002indirect] and the Netherlands [@nolet2013faltering]. However, the mechanism by which predation pressure at the family level translates into population level effects is not well understood.

Greater white-fronted geese _Anser albifrons albifrons_, hereafter whitefronts, are the most populous true geese wintering in continental western Europe [@Fox2017a], and offer an interesting opportunity to investigate the dynamics of Arctic goose families over space and time. Accounts from the wintering grounds suggest that in the Baltic-North Sea flyway population of whitefronts [@philippona1972blessgans], successful families winter farther west than smaller ones. Further, these families are observed in smaller flocks, but a decreasing size of flocks frome east to west confounds this. Family bonds reportedly weaken over a single winter, in contrast to the multi-year bonds of the Greenland subspecies _flavirostris_ [@10.2307/4088245].

We draw on field observations of whitefronts from their wintering grounds in the Netherlands and northern Germany [@mooij1991numbers], where they have been censused for some decades. The migration route, starting in the Russian Nenets, Yamal and Krasnoyarsk regions [@madsen1999goose, @kruckenberg2008white], spans a larger longitudinal than latitudinal gradient, the effect of which has not been extensively studied in migratory waterfowl. We exploit these peculiarities to test the expectations that: *1.* Larger families winter to the west, further from the breeding grounds *2.* Larger families winter in smaller flocks, *3.* Families decrease in size over the winter. Further, we attempt to characterise families in terms of their movement patterns and relate these to their eventual status.
