# Datamap

*a* Breeding grounds (ellipse) with Kolguyev Island (dot) and rough migration route (arrow) to wintering area (rectangle).
*b* Wintering grounds of greater white-fronted geese *Anser a. albifrons* in the with sites (circles, *n* = 64) where 51,037 successful families within 1,884 flocks were recorded. Triangles mark 21 splits seen in 13 GPS tracked families. Area shaded grey bounds 10,635 observations of marked geese. Data were collected from 2000 - 2016.

# Distance ~ family size

GLMM fit (lines) and mean distance of wintering site from Kolguyev Island (symbols) per number of family juveniles. First 60 days after arrival indicated in red, the remainder in blue. Triangles & dotted lines represent data from marked geese (dataset *C*), circles and solid lines family counts (dataset *B*).


# Family ~ time

GLMM fit (lines) and median number of juveniles in families on each day since goose autumn arrival (dots), for successful families in flocks (dataset *B*, red), and families of marked geese (dataset *C*, blue). Arrows show development of size of GPS tracked families.

# Flock trends

Predicted *(a)* flock size at distances from breeding grounds on Kolguyev. Predicted proportion of first winter juveniles in relation to *(b)* flock size, *(c)* days after arrival, and *(d)* summer predation index. Arrival dates were calculated from flight activity data, and predation index from Arctic rodent abundance (see *Methods*).
