The sizes of animal social units are highly variable. In migratory geese, families grow as juveniles are recruited each summer, and decrease when offspring disperse. The breeding success of Arctic geese depends largely on environmental factors, but the development of family bonds over time is not well studied. Using long term data, we show that both the number of families of wintering Russian Greater White-fronted geese (_Anser albifrons albifrons_) and their sizes are negatively affected by summer predation and that family bonds weaken over time.
