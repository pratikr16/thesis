\caption{Using different datasets to map the development of family sizes in Greater White-fronted geese. Crosses represent sites from which flocks and families within were counted. Triangles show locations where GPS tracked goose families split. Grey polygons show a kernel around all sites at which a goose bearing a numbered neckband was observed. Lines represent rivers, lakes, and coasts.}
