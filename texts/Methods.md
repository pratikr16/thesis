We used a combination of historical and contemporary whitefront winter distributions [@mooij1991numbers, @madsen1999goose, @fox2010current] from north-western continental Europe to define our study area (0째E - 10째E, 50째N - 54째N). Whitefronts here have stabilised at around 1.4 million individuals from historic lows in the 1960s, following several years of conservation-enabled exponential growth [@fox2010current, @Fox2017a].

Within this area, we collected the following classes of data from between the period autumn 2000 - spring 2017: (*A*) Flock counts in which observers censused flocks of whitefronts,(*B*) Family counts in which observers counted the sizes of successful families with at least one first winter juvenile (hereafter, juvenile) within a subset of the flocks above, (*C*) Observations of individually marked geese, including unsuccessful birds seen in a pair, and (*D*) Positions of goose families fitted with GPS/accelerometer transmitters, including flight events. These data were filtered to exclude records outside the spatial and temporal limits of our study. Records of single marked geese without juveniles were also excluded.

We also collected records of goose flight activity from Trektellen (*trektellen.org*) sites across the Netherlands.
We excluded flight activity records from sites close to night roosts, and records which did not match the direction of migration appropriate to the season. We used these data to find the beginning and end of the goose winter, which we took to begin with the first mass arrival of geese in autumn, and to end with the last mass departure in spring.

Following @jongejans2015naar, @blomqvist2002indirect and @nolet2013faltering, we estimated an index of summer predation for the breeding grounds of this population from rodent abundance data available online (*arcticbirds.net*). We calculated a pooled mean of 0 - 2 (low - high) lemming indices from sites in the region, taking care to include a value of 0 in each year to reflect absence of a lemming cycle in the core breeding area on Kolguyev. The index reflected higher values in years when lemming abundance had decreased significantly from the previous year.

We first tested whether (*A*) the number of juveniles, hereafter family size, explained the distance from the breeding grounds at which families were recorded. Within flocks, we tested whether (*B.1*) family sizes, and (*B.2*) the total number of families were explained by the number of birds in the flock, hereafter flock size, the number of days since the arrival of geese in autumn, and the level of summer predation. Finally, we tested (*B.3*) if the probability of family fission was explained by the hour of day, time since the last flight, days since arrival, and distance flown in the previous half hour.

To add context, we searched for (*C*) an effect on flock size of distance from the breeding grounds, the number of days since arrival, and summer predation, and examined whether (*D*) the proportion of juveniles in flocks was explained by the flock size, distance from the breeding grounds, number of days since arrival, and summer predation. All analyses were performed in the *R* environment [@R].

We used generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) as implemented by the *lme4* package [@lme4] in cases *A, B.1, B.3* and *C*, where we expected linear relationships. In cases *B.2* and *D*, we sought to include smooth functions of covariates as predictors, and used generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) as implemented by the *gamm4* and *mgcv* packages when specifying nested and *iid* random effects, respectively [@gamm4, @wood2013gam]. We specified the following *iid* random effects when using datasets *A* and *B*: breeding year (hereafter, year), observer identity and habitat type. Models using dataset *C* and *D* included goose identity and breeding year as random effects. We assessed the importance of each predictor using Type II Wald $\chi^2$ tests.
