Within the wintering area f whitefronts [@mooij1991numbers; @madsen1999goose; @fox2010current], we collected the following classes of data from between the period autumn 2000 - spring 2017: (*A*) Flock counts in which observers censused flocks of whitefronts,(*B*) Family counts in which observers counted the sizes of successful families with at least one first winter juvenile (hereafter, juvenile) within a subset of the flocks above, and (*C*) Observations of marked geese in pairs or with juveniles. These data were filtered to exclude records outside the spatial and temporal limits of our study.

We also collected (*D*) positions of goose families fitted with GPS loggers (2013, 2014: e-obs GmBH. Grünwald, Germany, & 2016: madebytheo, Amsterdam, Netherlands). 2016 loggers collected position data from take-off events. For all families, we identified days on which splits occurred. We counted the number of movements over 1km every day, and defined these as flights. For 2016 families, we identified the half-hour when they split, and used the available take-off data to find the time since the last take-off at each half-hour.

We also collected records of flock flight intensity from Trektellen (*trektellen.org*) sites across the Netherlands.
We excluded flight activity records from sites close to night roosts, and records which did not match the direction of migration appropriate to the season. We used these data to find the beginning and end of the goose winter, which we took to begin with the first mass arrival of geese in autumn, and to end with the last mass departure in spring.

Following previous studies [@jongejans2015naar, @nolet2013faltering; @blomqvist2002indirect] we estimated an index of summer predation for the breeding grounds of this population from rodent abundance data available online (*arcticbirds.net*). We calculated a pooled mean of 0 - 2 (low - high) lemming indices from sites in the region, taking care to include a value of 0 in each year to reflect absence of a lemming cycle in the core breeding area on Kolguyev. The index takes into account the change in lemming abundance, with higher values when lemming abundance had decreased from the previous year reflecting the increased predation pressure on Arctic birds from abundant predators switching to alternative prey.

We first tested whether (*1*) the number of juveniles, which determines family size, explained the distance from the breeding grounds at which families were recorded. Within flocks, we tested whether (*2.a*) family sizes, and (*2.b*) the total number of families were explained by the number of birds in the flock, hereafter flock size, the number of days since the arrival of geese in autumn, and the level of summer predation. To add context, we searched for (*3*) an effect on flock size of distance from the breeding grounds, the number of days since arrival, and summer predation, and examined whether (*4*) the proportion of juveniles in flocks was explained by the flock size, distance from the breeding grounds, number of days since arrival, and summer predation.

Further, we examined whether (*5.a*) the daily split probability was predicted by the days since arrival, the number of flights, the cumulative number of flights, the daily distance travelled, the cumulative distance travelled, and the family size. For the 2016 families where we had true flight data, we examined (*5.b*) the half-hourly split probability in relation to the the time since the last take-off and the distance travelled in the previous half hour. All analyses were performed in the *R* environment [@R].

We used *lme4* [@lme4] generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) to test *1, 2.a, 3, 5.a* and *5.b*, where we expected linear relationships. In cases *2.b* and *4*, we used *mgcv* [@wood2013gam] generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to include smooth functions of the flocksize (*2.b*) and the number of days since winter (*4, 5.b*) as predictors. We assessed the importance of each predictor using Type II Wald χ^2^ tests.
