# Methods

We used a combination of historical and contemporary whitefront winter distributions [@mooij1991numbers, @madsen1999goose, @fox2010current] from north-western continental Europe to define our study area (0째E - 10째E, 50째N - 54째N). The topography is largely flat and well drained [@poulsen_east_2017]. High intensity agriculture serves as a dense food source for up to 2.5 million individuals of five main species of migratory geese [@Koffijberg2017, @Fox2017b]. Whitefronts have stabilised at around 1.4 million individuals from historic lows in the 1960s, following several years of conservation-enabled exponential growth [@fox2010current, @Fox2017a].

Within this area, we collected the following four classes of data collected during winter (ending March 31): long term flocks counts (_n_ = 7,149, _SOVON_) and family frequencies (_n_ = 51,037), observation records of individually marked geese (_n_ = 10,635, _geese.org_), records of goose flight activity (_n_ = 6,266, _trektellen.org_), and high frequency tracks from thirteen families fitted with position logger/transmitters (_n_ = 64, _MPIO_).
These data had been filtered to exclude records of single individuals, and of double entries for pairs in which both marked birds were logged separately when seen together. We also excluded flight activity records from sites close to night roosts, and records which did not match the direction of migration appropriate to the season. We used these data to calculate the number of days between each observation and the beginning and end of the goose winter, which we took to begin with the mass arrival of geese in autumn, and to end with the end of their mass departure in spring. Following methods in @jongejans2015naar, @blomqvist2002indirect and @nolet2013faltering, we estimated a pooled mean index of summer predation for the breeding grounds [@madsen1999goose] of this population from rodent abundance data available online (_arcticbirds.net_), taking care to include a lemming index of 0 in each year to reflect conditions in the core breeding area on Kolguyev [@kruckenberg2008white].

We selected longitude, flock size, summer predation index, and number of days since autumn arrival as the main predictors required to test hypothesised effects on the number of juveniles (hereafter, family size), the flock size, and the proportion of first winter young in flocks. We used generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) or generalised additive models (GAMs) from the _lme4_ [@lme4] and _mgcv_  [@wood2013gam] packages in R [@R] as appropriate to model these effects. We used the $\Omega^{2}_{0}$ metric [@SIM:SIM1572] to compare the residual variance of full GLMMs against the residual variance of their fixed intercept only null equivalents, and the inbuilt $R^2$ value from the _mgcv_ package for GAMs to assess the goodness of fit of our models. We assessed the importance of each predictor using Type II Wald $\chi^2$ tests. Tables below show model structure and output.
